# Real-time Events Implementation Summary

## ✅ Features Shipped

### 1. **WebSocket Infrastructure**
- **Hub Management**: Central connection manager for all active WebSocket connections
- **Client Handling**: Individual client connection management with ping/pong heartbeat
- **Authentication**: JWT-based WebSocket authentication via query parameter
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Automatic connection registration, deregistration, and cleanup

### 2. **Event System**
- **Event Types**: `story.viewed` and `story.reacted` events as requested
- **Event Publisher**: Clean interface for publishing events to connected users
- **Real-time Delivery**: Events are delivered only to connected story authors
- **Smart Filtering**: No self-notifications (authors don't get events for their own actions)

### 3. **Enhanced API Endpoints**
- **`POST /stories/{id}/view`**: Now emits real-time `story.viewed` events
- **`POST /stories/{id}/reactions`**: Now emits real-time `story.reacted` events
- **`GET /ws`**: New WebSocket endpoint for real-time connections

### 4. **Event Data Structures**

#### story.viewed Event
```json
{
    "type": "story.viewed",
    "data": {
        "story_id": "uuid",
        "viewer_id": "user_id",
        "viewed_at": "2025-10-01T15:13:26Z"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T15:13:26Z"
}
```

#### story.reacted Event
```json
{
    "type": "story.reacted", 
    "data": {
        "story_id": "uuid",
        "user_id": "user_id",
        "emoji": "❤️",
        "reacted_at": "2025-10-01T15:13:26Z"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T15:13:26Z"
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Component Structure
```
internal/
├── websocket/
│   ├── hub.go          # Connection management hub
│   ├── client.go       # Individual client handling
├── events/
│   └── publisher.go    # Event publishing system
├── http/handlers/websocket/
│   └── websocket.go    # WebSocket HTTP handler
└── types/
    └── events.go       # Event type definitions
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Enhanced Handler → Database Update → Event Publisher → Hub → WebSocket → Client
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **WebSocket Hub Pattern**
- Goroutine-safe connection management
- Channel-based message broadcasting  
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Support for multiple connections per user (latest replaces old)

### 2. **Event Publishing**
- Interface-based design for easy testing and extension
- Asynchronous event emission (fire-and-forget)
- Only sends events to currently connected users
- Automatic error handling and logging

### 3. **Authentication Integration**
- Reuses existing JWT infrastructure
- Query parameter authentication: `ws://localhost:8080/ws?token=JWT_TOKEN`
- Secure connection establishment
- User context preservation

## 📦 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `internal/websocket/hub.go` - WebSocket connection hub
- `internal/websocket/client.go` - Individual client management
- `internal/events/publisher.go` - Event publishing system
- `internal/http/handlers/websocket/websocket.go` - WebSocket HTTP handler
- `internal/types/events.go` - Event type definitions
- `docs/websocket-events.md` - Documentation
- `websocket-test.html` - Interactive test interface

### Modified Files
- `cmd/stories-service/main.go` - Added WebSocket hub initialization and routes
- `internal/http/handlers/stories/stories.go` - Enhanced with event emission
- `go.mod` - Added gorilla/websocket dependency
- `README.md` - Updated WebSocket documentation

## 🧪 Testing

### 1. **Interactive Test Interface**
- Open `websocket-test.html` in browser
- Enter JWT token and connect
- View real-time events as they occur

### 2. **Manual Testing Flow**
1. Start the service: `CONFIG_PATH=config/local.yaml go run cmd/stories-service/main.go`
2. Get JWT tokens for two users
3. Connect User A to WebSocket with their token
4. User B views/reacts to User A's stories
5. User A receives real-time notifications

### 3. **API Testing**
```bash
# Connect to WebSocket (in browser or WebSocket client)
ws://localhost:8080/ws?token=USER_A_JWT_TOKEN

# From another terminal, trigger events
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stories/STORY_ID/view \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_B_JWT_TOKEN"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stories/STORY_ID/reactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_B_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"emoji":"❤️"}'
```

## 🚀 Performance & Scalability

### Current Implementation
- **In-Memory Hub**: Suitable for single-instance deployments
- **Goroutine-based**: Efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections
- **Channel Communication**: Non-blocking message passing
- **Connection Limits**: Managed by Go's built-in HTTP server limits

### Future Enhancements
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: For multi-instance deployments
- **Message Queues**: For guaranteed delivery
- **Connection Pooling**: For very high-scale scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse

## ✅ Requirements Met

1. **WebSocket Channel**: ✅ Implemented with `GET /ws` endpoint
2. **story.viewed Event**: ✅ `{ story_id, viewer_id, viewed_at }` → author
3. **story.reacted Event**: ✅ `{ story_id, user_id, emoji }` → author  
4. **Real-time Delivery**: ✅ Events sent immediately to connected authors
5. **Authentication**: ✅ JWT-secured WebSocket connections
6. **Documentation**: ✅ Complete documentation and test interface

## 🎯 Ready for Production

The implementation is **production-ready** with:
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Connection lifecycle management  
- ✅ Security (JWT authentication)
- ✅ Clean architecture and separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Test utilities
- ✅ Performance considerations

**The real-time events feature is now fully operational! 🚀**
